# Car-Rental-System-using-Java



This Java-based Car Rental System is a console application that enables customers to rent and return cars from a predefined list. It uses four core classes—`Car`, `Customer`, `Rental`, and `CarRentalSystem`—to manage the rental process. Cars have unique IDs, pricing, and availability status, while customers are automatically assigned IDs upon rental. The system tracks active rentals, calculates total cost based on rental days, and updates car availability accordingly. Through a user-friendly menu, it facilitates renting available cars and returning previously rented ones, offering a basic yet functional structure for managing car rentals.
